# Key takeaways from the video on "Set and Map - Newer loopable data types":

**- Set:** Stores unique values, preventing duplicates. Items are added using the `add` method, and you can check for existence with the `has` method. Sets do not allow direct access by index.

**- Map:** Stores key-value pairs and remembers the order of insertion. Keys and values are accessed using methods like `get` and `has`. Maps are **more predictable in terms of order** compared to objects.

These data types offer additional features compared to arrays and objects, making them useful for specific scenarios in JavaScript.
