# Here are the key takeaways from the "Regular expressions" video:

**- Pattern Matching:** Regular expressions allow you to search text for patterns rather than exact matches, making them powerful for text processing.
**- Syntax:** In JavaScript, regular expressions are defined between two slashes, e.g., `/pattern/`.
**- Modifiers:** You can use flags like `i` for case-insensitive matching and special characters like `^`and `$` to match the beginning and end of strings, respectively.

These points should help you understand the basics of using regular expressions in JavaScript.
