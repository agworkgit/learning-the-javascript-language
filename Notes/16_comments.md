# Here are the key takeaways from the "Readability: Comments" video:

**- Types of Comments:** JavaScript supports two types of comments: line comments `//` and block comments `/* */`.

**- Documentation:** Comments are primarily used for documenting code, making it easier for others (or yourself) to understand what the code does.

**- Debugging:** Comments can also be used to disable parts of code for debugging purposes.

These points should help you understand how to effectively use comments in your JavaScript code.
