# In the video on "Arithmetic operators," here are the key takeaways:

## Basic Arithmetic Operators:

**- Addition (+):** Adds two numbers (e.g., 2 + 5 = 7).

**- Subtraction (-):** Subtracts the second number from the first (e.g., 4 - 3 = 1).

**- Multiplication (*):** Multiplies two numbers (e.g., 3 * 5 = 15).
Division (/): Divides the first number by the second (e.g., 36 / 6 = 6).

**- Modulus Operator (%):** Returns the remainder of a division (e.g., 20 % 2 = 0 for even numbers, 19 % 2 = 1 for odd numbers).

## Incrementing and Decrementing:

**- Increment (++):** Increases a variable's value by one.

**- Decrement (--):** Decreases a variable's value by one.

**- Addition Assignment (+=):** Adds a specified value to a variable (e.g., counter += 5).

**- String Concatenation:** The + operator can also be used to concatenate strings (e.g., "cat" + "dog" = "catdog").

These operators are fundamental for performing arithmetic operations and manipulating data in JavaScript.
