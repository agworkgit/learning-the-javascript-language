# Here are the key takeaways from the video on "Promises, async, and await":

**- Callbacks:** Functions passed as arguments to other functions, often leading to "callback hell" when nested deeply.

**- Promises:** Objects that handle asynchronous actions more cleanly, allowing chaining with .then() for better readability.

**- Async/Await:** Keywords introduced in ECMAScript 2017 that simplify working with promises, making asynchronous code easier to read and write.

These concepts are crucial for handling asynchronous tasks in JavaScript efficiently.
