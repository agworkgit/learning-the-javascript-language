# Key takeaways from "Type checking":

**- Typeof Operator:** JavaScript uses the `typeof` operator to check the type of a variable, returning a string that indicates the type (e.g., "string", "number", "boolean").

**- Handling Special Cases:** Some types, like arrays and `null`, can return unexpected results with `typeof`. For example, `typeof` an `array` returns "object".

**- Advanced Type Checking:** For more precise type checking, especially with arrays and special values like `NaN`, use additional methods like `Array.isArray()` or `Number.isNaN()`.
