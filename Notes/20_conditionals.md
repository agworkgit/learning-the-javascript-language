# The key takeaways from the "Conditionals" are:

**- If Statements:** An `if` statement allows you to create forks in the logical flow of your code, executing different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

**- Branching (Logical Forks):** You can use `if` statements to branch your code, performing different actions depending on whether conditions are true or false.

**- Else and Else If:** You can extend `if` statements with `else` and `else if` clauses to handle multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code accordingly.

**`if` `else` statements can be nested inside other `if` `else` statements**

These concepts are fundamental for controlling the flow of your JavaScript programs.
