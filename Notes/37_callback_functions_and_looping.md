# Key takeaways from the video on "Callback functions and looping":

**- Callback Functions:** These are functions passed as arguments to other functions and executed within those functions. They are widely used in modern JavaScript.

***"Callback function is a piece of jargon, meaning a function that's passed as an argument, into another function and executed in that function."***

**- Array Methods:** Methods like `map` and `forEach` use callback functions to perform operations on each item in an array. `map` returns a new array, while `forEach` simply iterates over the array.

**- Event Handlers:** Callback functions are also used in event handling, such as responding to user actions like clicks or key presses.

This video emphasizes the importance and versatility of callback functions in JavaScript, especially in array operations and event handling.
