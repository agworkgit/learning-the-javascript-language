# Here are the key takeaways from the "Simple comparisons" video:

**- Equality and Inequality Operators:** Learn about the strict equality `===` and strict inequality `!==` operators, which check if two values are identical or not.

**- Non-Strict Equality Operators:** Understand the regular equality `==` and inequality `!=` operators, which perform type conversion before comparison.

**- Relational Operators:** Explore relational operators like less than `<`, greater than `>`, less than or equal to `<=`, and greater than or equal to `>=`, which compare numerical values.

These concepts are fundamental for making comparisons in JavaScript and are widely used in programming.
