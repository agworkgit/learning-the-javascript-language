# Here are the key takeaways from the "Places to tinker" video:

**- JavaScript Consoles in Browsers:** You can use the JavaScript console built into any web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari) to try out JavaScript code quickly and easily.

**- Node.js Console:** Node.js provides a command-line utility called Node, which allows you to experiment with JavaScript in a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) environment.

**- GitHub Codespaces:** This course uses GitHub Codespaces, which provides a cloud-based development environment where you can access both the browser console and Node.js without needing to install anything locally.
