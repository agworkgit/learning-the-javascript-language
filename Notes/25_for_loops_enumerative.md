# "For loops: Enumerative", here are the key takeaways:

**- Enumerative `for` loops:** These loops are used to iterate over arrays or objects, and they can take various forms like `for...in` and `for...of`.

**- Iterating over arrays:** The `for...in` loop iterates over the *keys of an array*, while the `for...of` loop iterates *over the values directly*.

**- Key order:** The order of *keys* in a `for...in` loop is not guaranteed by the JavaScript specification, so if the order matters, a sequential for loop might be more reliable.

**- Enumerating objects:** When using `for...in` with objects, it's important to check for inherited properties using `.hasOwnProperty` to avoid unintended enumeration.
