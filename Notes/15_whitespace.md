# Here are the key takeaways from the "Readability: Whitespace" video:

**- Improving Readability:** Adding whitespace (spaces, returns) makes code easier to read without affecting its execution.

**- Balanced Use:** Avoid excessive whitespace as it can make code hard to read in a different way.

**- Tools and Standards:** Use tools like Prettier to automatically format code and follow team coding standards for consistent readability.

These points should help you understand the importance and effective use of whitespace in your JavaScript code.
