# Here are the key takeaways from the "Logical operators" video:

**- Logical Operators:** The video covers the three most common logical operators in JavaScript: `&&` (and), `||` (or), and `!` (not).

**- Usage:**
`&&` (and) returns `true` **only if all** conditions are `true`.
`||` (or) returns `true` if **at least one** condition is true.
`!` (not) **inverts** the truthiness of a condition.

**- Operator Precedence:** `&&` (and) has higher precedence than `||` (or), meaning it is evaluated first in expressions without parentheses.

These concepts are crucial for making complex logical comparisons in your code.
