**- Definition of Booleans:** Booleans are a data type that can only have two values: true or false. They are used to represent truth values in JavaScript.

**- Syntax:** Booleans must be spelled exactly as true or false in lowercase. Any other spelling or capitalization will result in errors.

**- Usage:** Booleans are often used to track the state of a program or to make decisions based on conditions. For example, a variable can be set to true or false to indicate whether a button has been clicked.

**- Comparisons:** Booleans are essential for making comparisons in code, such as checking if two variables have the same value using ===.

These points should help you understand the basics of Booleans and their significance in JavaScript.
