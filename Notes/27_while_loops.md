# "While loops," here are the key takeaways:

**- While Loop Structure:** A `while` loop continues to execute as long as its condition remains `true`. It's useful when you don't know the number of iterations in advance.

**- Comparison with For Loops:** While loops can be more readable for certain conditions, especially when the stopping condition is clear and upfront.

**- Infinite Loops:** Be cautious of creating infinite loops, which occur when the loop's condition never becomes `false`.

**- Do-While Loop:** This variation ensures the loop's body executes at least once, regardless of the condition.

These points should help you understand the basics and applications of while loops in JavaScript.
