# Key takeaways from "For loops: Sequential":

**- Initialization, Condition, and Increment:** A `for` loop in JavaScript consists of three main parts: initializing a variable (often `i`), setting a condition for the loop to continue, and incrementing the variable.

**- Loop Execution:** The loop executes the code within its curly braces repeatedly until the condition is no longer met.

**- Practical Use:** For loops are commonly used to iterate over arrays or perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

These points should help you understand the basics of using for loops in JavaScript.
