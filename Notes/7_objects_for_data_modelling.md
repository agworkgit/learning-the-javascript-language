# Here are the key takeaways from the "Using objects for data modeling" video:

**- Data Modeling with Objects:** Objects can be used to represent real-world entities and their attributes in code. For example, an object can represent an animal with properties like genus, species, and commonName.

**- Customizable Properties:** The properties of an object are entirely customizable based on the requirements of your program. You can include any relevant data as key-value pairs.

**- Boolean Flags:** Objects can include Boolean properties (flags) to represent `true/false` values, such as whether an animal is noisy or deadly.

These points should help you understand how to use objects for data modeling in JavaScript.
