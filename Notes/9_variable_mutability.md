# Here are the key takeaways from the "Variable mutability" video:

**- Mutable vs. Immutable Variables:** Variables declared with `var` or `let` can be changed later (mutable), while variables declared with `const` cannot be changed once set (immutable).

**- Use of const:** Use `const` for values that should not change, such as constants like dozen or halfDozen, to prevent accidental modifications.

**- Error Handling:** Attempting to change a `const` variable will result in an error, helping to avoid hidden mistakes in your code.

These points should help you understand the different ways to declare variables and their mutability in JavaScript.
