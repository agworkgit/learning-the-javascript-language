# Here are the key takeaways from the "Objects" video:

**- Definition of Objects:** Objects are more complex data structures that encapsulate multiple values as **key-value** pairs. They are foundational in JavaScript for representing complex data.

**- Creating Objects:** The simplest way to create an object is using an object literal with curly braces `{}`. For example, `let obj = {};` creates an empty object.

**- Key-Value Pairs:** Objects store data in key-value pairs, where keys are labels (often strings) and values can be any data type, including numbers, strings, Booleans, or even other objects.

These points should help you understand the basics of working with objects in JavaScript.
