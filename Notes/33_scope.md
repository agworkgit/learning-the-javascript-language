# Key takeaways from the video "Scope in JavaScript":

**- Scope Definition:** Scope refers to where variables are defined and what parts of the code can access them. It differentiates between global scope (accessible anywhere) and local scope (accessible within a limited context, such as a function).

**- Global Variables:** Avoid creating global variables as they can be accessed and modified by any piece of code, potentially causing conflicts and bugs.

**- Local Variables:** Use `var`, `let`, and `const` to create locally-scoped variables. `var` is **function-scoped**, while `let` and `const` are **block-scoped**, meaning they are limited to the block defined by curly braces.

These points emphasize the importance of understanding and managing variable scope to avoid potential issues in your code.
