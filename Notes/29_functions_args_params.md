# Key takeaways from "Arguments and parameters in functions":

**- Arguments and Parameters:** Functions can take arguments (also called parameters) which are the data the function acts on. These are defined within the parentheses in the function declaration.

**- Data Processing:** Functions can be used to process data, such as modifying a string or performing calculations, and return the modified data.

**- Reusable Code:** By defining functions with arguments, you can reuse the same code with different inputs, making your code more efficient and easier to maintain.

These points help you understand how to effectively use functions to handle data in JavaScript.
