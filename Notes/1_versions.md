Here are the key takeaways from the "Versions of JavaScript" video:

JavaScript Versions: JavaScript evolves over time with new features and bug fixes. The versions are named according to the standards maintained by ECMA International.

ECMAScript 5 (ES5): This version has been widely supported by modern web browsers since around 2012 and is considered a general baseline.

ECMAScript 2015 (ES6): This is the current baseline for the course, offering many new features with good browser support. Newer versions are released annually, adding more features.

Transpilers: Tools like Babel can convert newer JavaScript code to older versions (like ES5) to ensure compatibility with older browsers.

This should give you a good understanding of the evolution and compatibility of JavaScript versions.
