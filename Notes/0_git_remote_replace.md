# You can update your Git remote by following these steps:

1. Check Existing Remotes
Run the following command to list your current remotes:

`git remote -v`
This will show something like:

`origin  https://github.com/username/learning-the-javascript-language-4369302.git (fetch)`

`origin  https://github.com/username/learning-the-javascript-language-4369302.git (push)`

2. Remove the Old Remote
Run:
`git remote remove origin`

This will detach the incorrect remote.

3. Add the New Remote
Now, add the correct repository:

`git remote add origin https://github.com/username/learning-the-javascript-language.git`

4. Verify the Change
Check if the remote has been updated correctly:

`git remote -v`

You should see:

`origin  https://github.com/username/learning-the-javascript-language.git (fetch)`

`origin  https://github.com/username/learning-the-javascript-language.git (push)`

5. Push to the New Remote
If your local branch is already set up for tracking, you can push with:

`git push origin main` or replace "main" with your branch name

If you haven't set a tracking branch, use:

`git push --set-upstream origin main`  

Adjust "main" if necessary
