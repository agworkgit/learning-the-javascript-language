# Key takeaways from "More on function arguments":

**- Default Values:** You can set default values for function arguments by using the `=` sign in the function definition. This allows the function to be called with fewer arguments than it expects.

**- Multiple Arguments:** Functions can handle multiple arguments, and the order in which they are used matters. These are called **positional arguments**.

**- Arguments Object:** The arguments object is an array-like object that allows functions to handle an arbitrary number of arguments. You can iterate over this object to access all passed arguments.

These points will help you understand how to work with function arguments more effectively in JavaScript.
