# Here are the key takeaways from the video "Functions and scope":

**- Variable Scope:** Functions create their own scope in JavaScript. Variables defined inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside of it.

**- Global vs. Local Variables:** A variable defined outside any function is in the global scope and can be accessed anywhere. However, if a variable with the same name is defined inside a function, it is a separate local variable.

**- Block Scope with let and const:** Unlike `var`, the `let` and `const` keywords allow you to define variables that are scoped to the nearest enclosing block, not just functions.

These points highlight how scope works in JavaScript and how it affects variable accessibility and management.
