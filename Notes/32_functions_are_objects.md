# Key takeaways from the video "Functions are objects":

**- Functions as Objects:** In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens and are treated as objects. This means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

**- Function Declarations vs. Expressions:** Functions can be defined using declarations or expressions. Declarations are hoisted, while expressions are not.

**- Anonymous Functions:** Function expressions can be anonymous, meaning they do not have a name. These are often used as arguments to other functions.

**- Practical Use:** Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, such as setTimeout, which takes a function as its first argument and executes it after a specified delay.

These points highlight the flexibility and power of functions in JavaScript.
